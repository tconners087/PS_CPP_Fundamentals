'*.h' files indicate header files. '*.cpp' files often implement functions contained in .h files;
therefore, .h files must be included in .cpp files.

A .cpp file implementing a class templated in a .h file has access to private variables in the included .h file.

In main, the header .h file of a class is included and allows class instantiation and function calls,
even though the function may exist in the .h file's associated .cpp file.
